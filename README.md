# JWJ-1 Assignment Directions

## -Create your own branch and name it after yourself. Then make sure you are in YOUR branch, because it is where you will push your assignments. If you push to main that will count as an AUTOMATIC FAIL; given that pushing directly to main is huge problem for all the reasons we discussed this past code jam (if you need a reminder, just ask!)
## -Implement the methods that asked for in the "Shelter.java" file. Use the main method to ensure that your methods actually work!!


## I'll be grading you based on whether or not the methods you've made actually work! Please reach out if you have any questions!!
